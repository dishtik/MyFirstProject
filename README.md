1. File text was just a file to test/practice how to upload file on git.
2. File SectretSanta.py is code for first program where I applied my coding knowledge in real world.

Secret Santa:
Many of us are familiar with exchanging gifts with our friends during Christmas season. In that gift exchange ritual, all friends write their names individually on chits and put those chits into a container. Then randomly one by one each person picks a chit. They are supposed to get gift for the person whose name was written on chit they picked.
This code automates that lucky draw process.
All participants' names are stored in a list. Then randomly, pairs (Santa and GiftTo) are made. In case same name comes in one pair, then code changes the pair.
Thus, we get a list of Santas and Whom they are supposed to gift.
